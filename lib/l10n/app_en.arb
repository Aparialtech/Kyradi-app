  "howItWorksStep1Title": "1) Location selection and availability",

  "howItWorksStep6Body": "Three options are available: (1) Pay at hotel: payment is collected at the location, and a commission may apply. (2) Card payment: secure MagicPay checkout. (3) Installments: a fee may apply and is reflected in the total.",
  "howItWorksStep7Title": "7) Payment success or failure",
  "howItWorksStep7Body": "If payment succeeds, drop-off is completed and a PIN is generated. If it fails, the app shows a clear error and lets you retry; drop-off is not completed.",
  "howItWorksStep8Title": "8) Pickup with PIN",
  "howItWorksStep8Body": "After successful drop-off, a pickup PIN is generated. It is shown on screen and can also be emailed. Even if email fails, the process continues; the PIN is used for pickup verification.",
  "howItWorksFaqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "howItWorksFaq1Q": "Why is payment required at drop-off?",
  "howItWorksFaq1A": "Payment activates the service and keeps availability accurate. Drop-off cannot be completed without payment.",
  "howItWorksFaq2Q": "Why can the estimate change?",
  "howItWorksFaq2A": "Estimates are based on size, duration, and times. Actual drop/pickup times can change the price.",
  "howItWorksFaq3Q": "What if a location is closed or full?",
  "howItWorksFaq3A": "The app will show this clearly. Choose another location or a different time.",
  "howItWorksFaq4Q": "If I choose pay at hotel, will a card screen open?",
  "howItWorksFaq4A": "No. Payment is collected at the location. A commission may be reflected in the total.",
  "howItWorksFaq5Q": "How do installments work?",
  "howItWorksFaq5A": "Select installments during card payment. Any installment fee is reflected in the total.",
  "howItWorksFaq6Q": "What does premium protection provide?",
  "howItWorksFaq6A": "It adds extra coverage beyond standard protection. The estimate card shows the fee.",
  "howItWorksFaq7Q": "What if I lose my PIN?",
  "howItWorksFaq7A": "You can resend it by email and view it in your profile or reservation details. Support can help if needed.",
  "howItWorksFaq8Q": "Payment succeeded but the app didn’t update. What should I do?",
